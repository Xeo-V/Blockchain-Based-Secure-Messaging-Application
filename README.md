Project Development Roadmap

Welcome to our project's development roadmap. This document outlines our strategic approach to building a state-of-the-art decentralized messaging application. Our focus is on privacy, security, and user sovereignty, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to protect and empower our users.
Development Phases

 Ongoing: User Registration and Authentication

    Implemented a decentralized identity management system utilizing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and self-sovereign identity solutions to empower users with control over their digital identities.
    Integrated zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to facilitate anonymous user registration and authentication, ensuring privacy and security without compromising on user experience.

 Next Up: Encryption and Key Management

    To implement end-to-end encryption using protocols such as the Signal Protocol or the Double Ratchet Algorithm to secure communications.
    Development of secure key exchange mechanisms using algorithms like Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is underway.
    Ensuring forward secrecy to protect past communications, even if long-term keys are compromised, is a priority.

 Blockchain Integration

    Preparing to set up and integrate Monero for enhanced privacy and security within our application.
    Planning to implement smart contracts or similar on-chain logic to manage message storage, retrieval, and other application-specific functionalities.
    Incorporating anonymity-enhancing techniques such as Ring Signatures to obfuscate the sender's identity and safeguard user privacy.

 Decentralized Networking

    Implementing a decentralized networking protocol like libp2p for robust peer-to-peer communication between nodes.
    Developing a gossip protocol to propagate messages across the network while ensuring the anonymity of users.

 Backend Development

    Integrating a decentralized storage solution like IPFS for the efficient storage and distribution of the application's code and assets.
    Backend logic and APIs are in the design phase, with a focus on leveraging smart contracts on the Monero blockchain for added security and functionality.

 GUI Development

    Designing and developing the graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a user-friendly and intuitive experience for messaging, contacts management, and other application features.
    Considering the use of ImGui or a similar library for this purpose.

 Security Audits and Testing

    Planning comprehensive security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    Commitment to secure coding practices and adherence to industry-standard security guidelines is fundamental to our development process.

     Deployment and Maintenance
        Preparing for deployment on the Monero blockchain network and decentralized infrastructure.
        A strategy for continuous monitoring, maintenance, and updates is being developed to address any emerging issues or vulnerabilities.

Our commitment to staying at the forefront of blockchain, cryptography, and related technologies is unwavering. We aim to ensure that our application remains secure, compliant, and cutting-edge, providing our users with the best possible experience.

Thank you for following our journey. Stay tuned for more updates as we progress through our development roadmap.
