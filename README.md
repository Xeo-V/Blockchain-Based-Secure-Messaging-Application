*Ongoing*
    User Registration and Authentication:
        Implement a decentralized identity management system using technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) or self-sovereign identity solutions.
        Integrate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for anonymous user registration and authentication.

*Next Up*
    Encryption and Key Management:
        Implement end-to-end encryption using protocols like the Signal Protocol or the Double Ratchet Algorithm.
        Develop secure key exchange mechanisms using algorithms like Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).
        Ensure forward secrecy to protect past communications even if long-term keys are compromised.
    Blockchain Integration:
        Set up the chosen blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum, Monero, Zcash) and integrate it with your application.
        Implement smart contracts or similar on-chain logic to handle message storage, retrieval, and other application-specific functionality.
        Incorporate anonymity-enhancing techniques like Ring Signatures (for Monero) or zk-SNARKs (for Zcash) to obfuscate the sender's identity.
    Decentralized Networking:
        Implement a decentralized networking protocol like libp2p or IPFS for peer-to-peer communication between nodes.
        Develop a gossip protocol to propagate messages across the network while preserving anonymity.
    Backend Development:
        Integrate a decentralized storage solution like IPFS or Swarm for storing and distributing the application's code and assets.
        Develop the backend logic and APIs required for your application, potentially using smart contracts on the blockchain.
    GUI Development:
        Design and develop the graphical user interface (GUI) using ImGui or a similar library.
        Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive experience for messaging, contacts management, and other application features.
    Security Audits and Testing:
        Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing throughout the development process.
        Identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your application's encryption, blockchain integration, networking, and other components.
        Implement secure coding practices and follow industry-standard security guidelines.
    Deployment and Maintenance:
        Deploy your application on the chosen blockchain network and decentralized infrastructure.
        Continuously monitor and maintain the application, addressing any issues or vulnerabilities that may arise.
        Stay up-to-date with the latest developments in blockchain, cryptography, and related technologies to ensure your application remains secure and compliant.
